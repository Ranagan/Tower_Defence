# Tower_Defence

To test azure: Open test Azure scene. You can enter data and retrieve it from a leaderboard hosted on azure.

To test the game: Open the main scene. Coins increase automatically. Press 'X' to spawn a character (will be mapped to a button for release). Spawning a character spends your coins. Characters will automatically attack the enemy base. Friendly characters will not collide with each other, but will collide with enemies and deal damage. When health reaches zero the object is destroyed. All I need to finish is a scene when the enemy or friendly base is destroyed.
